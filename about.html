   <center> <p style="color:rgb(100, 66, 4);text-align:center;"><b>This Web-based Waste Food Management system can assist in collecting the<br>
   leftover food from hotels & restaurants to distribute among those in need.<br>
   NGOs that are helping poor communities to battle against starvation & <br>
  malnutrition can raise a request for food supply from restaurants through <br>
  this Website. Once the request is accepted, the NGOs can collect the food from <br>
  the restaurants for its distribution. In this way this Web-based waste food management<br>
  system will help restaurants to reduce food waste and will help in feeding <br>
  he poor and needy people.In this system, we have tried to reduce restaurant <br>
  food wastage by giving waste food to NGOs. NGOs will raise a request, in case of <br>
  any leftover food restaurants Sustainable Management of Food is a systematic approach <br>
  that seeks to reduce wasted  food and its associated impacts over the entire life cycle,<br>
  starting with the use of natural resources, manufacturing, sales, and consumption <br>
  and ending with decisions on recovery or final disposal.EPA works to promote innovation<br>
  and highlight the value and efficient management of food as a resource.Through the sustainable <br>
  management of food, we can help businesses and consumers save money, provide <br>
  a bridge in our communities for those who do not have enough to eat,and conserve<br>
  resources for future generations. </b></p></center>

  <center><b><u><p  style="color:blue">Who we are?</b></u></p></center>
  <center><p style="color:rgb(100, 66, 4);text-align:center;"><b>It is a zero-fund organisation that works to get surplus food from restaurants <br> and the community
  to serve less fortunate people.Our local chapters are run by friends<br>
   and colleagues, who hope to create a difference in their own unique way. <br>
  For example, restaurants in the neighbourhood Green Park, will contribute <br>
  to the homeless of the locality, through volunteers who live in Green Park.<br>
   Our institure consists of  largely students and young working professionals – everyone <br>
   does this in their free time. 
  The lesser fortunate sections of society we serve <br>include homeless families, 
  orphanages, patients from public hospitals, and old age homes.</b></p></center>
